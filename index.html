                 <h4>Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) Preparation</h4>
                 <p>We prepare a unique and comprehensive SWPPP to each construction project or industrial facility that satisfies the requirements of State and Federal regulations and permits (Construction, Industrial & Municipal). In particular, the SWPPP will be designed to insure compliance with all the objectives listed in the designated National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit(s).</p>

                 <h4>SMARTS processing and Notice of Intent Preparation</h4>
                 <p>The first step to apply for the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit coverage is to create an account in the Stormwater Multi-Application Reporting and Tracking System (SMARTS) developed by the State Water Resources Control Board. Following account set up we provide filing of the Notice of Intent (NOI) and all other related Permit Registration Documents (PRDs). </p>

                 <h4>RAIN EVENT ACTION PLAN (REAP) Preparation and Inspection</h4>
                 <p>This is a special requirement for construction projects with Risk Level 2 and 3. Rain Event Action Plan (REAP) is necessary for Risk Level 2 and 3 traditional construction projects to ensure that active construction sites have adequate erosion and sediment controls implemented prior to the onset of a storm event, even if construction is planned only during the dry season. The REAP may be prepared in conjunction with pre, during and post storm inspections along with stormwater sampling and analysis reporting during a qualified rain event.</p>

                 <h4>STORMWATER SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS</h4>
                 <p>NPDES permits require stormwater sampling and analysis for construction sites with Risk Level 2 and 3 (i.e. minimum: pH and Turbidity) and for industrial facilities(i.e. minimum: Total Suspended Solids (TSS), pH, Specific Conductance, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) or Oil and Grease (O&G)). Samples will be collected during rain events and the parameter analysis will be conducted either on-site or in a State approved laboratory.</p>

                 <h4>STROM WATER POLLUTION PREVENTION TRAINING </h4>
                 <p>Per the NPDES permits, individuals responsible for SWPPP preparation and implementation should be trained. This includes those personnel responsible for installation, inspection, maintenance and repair of all control measures on-site known as Best Management Practices (BMPs).
                 Ranging from multi-media presentations to one-on-one sessions, we provide different formats of on-site or class-room training for industrial and construction personnel. A certification letter will be provided to the trainees after each session. </p>

                 <p>A BMP Status Report can help project managers evaluating the BMPs installed on the project and planning for the BMPs that will be deployed on site. The BMP Status Report can help to easily determine what could be expected to be seen on the project site at any period of the job life cycle. The report can be prepared weekly, bi-weekly or monthly depending on the project work schedule. </p>
